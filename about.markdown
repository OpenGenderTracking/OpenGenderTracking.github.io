The OpenGenderTracking project aims to build software that assists with analyzing the gender balance of news content.

<div class="goals">
  <h2>Goals</h2>
  Our initial goal is to create a standalone service that accepts content and is able to provide metrics about its gender balance. The service will be extendable to allow different sources of content, and have a variety of metrics that will return the gender balance of the content provided.
