The OpenGenderTracking project aims to build software that assists with analyzing the gender balance of news content.

## Goals

Our initial goal is to create a standalone service that accepts content and is able to provide metrics about its gender balance. The service will be extendable to allow different sources of content, and have a variety of metrics that will return the gender balance of the content provided.

## Where

You can find us on github at <a href="https://github.com/opengendertracking">github/OpenGenderTracking</a>.
