As we continue to research the topic of gender balance tracking in media here, we will collect notable resources on the subject.

## Projects
<br>
#### [Global Media Monitoring Project](http://whomakesthenews.org/)

The Global Media Monitoring Project is the largest and longest longitudinal study on the representation of women in the world’s media.  It is also the largest advocacy initiative in the world on changing the representation of women in the media.  It is unique in involving participants ranging from grassroots community organizations to university students and researchers to media practitioners, all of whom participate on a voluntary basis.

#### [The Op-Ed Project](http://www.theopedproject.org/)

The OpEd Project is social venture founded to increase the range of voices and quality of ideas we hear in the world. 
Their starting goal is to increase the number of women thought leaders contributing to key commentary forums—which feed all other media, and drive thought leadership across all industries—to a tipping point.
